## JSX components

By default, you can also write your components by using `render` function and jsx, but you may also notice there's a `JSX format` option in command-line prompt when your are initializing a new project:

If you enable this the `vue-cli` won't generate `.vue` components but `.js` components. Either way you can use JSX and single-file components.
